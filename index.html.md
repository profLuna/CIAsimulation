## Introduction and Purpose

This document provides an analysis and simulation of the Cumulative Impact Analysis (CIA) process for clean energy projects as proposed by the Office of Environmental Justice and Equity (OEJE). The simulation focuses on the Sudbbury-Hudson underground transmission line to illustrate the steps in the CIA process and output generated. The rest of the document proceeds stepwise through the CIA process as described by OEJE. 

### Step 1. Identify Specific Geographic Area (SGA) of Project

The first step is to identify the Specific Geographic Area (SGA) of the proposed project. The SGA of a project is defined by the geographic location of the project and its physical footprint, as well as a radius around the project determined by the Energy Facilities Siting Board (EFSB). @tbl-sga below describes the radii of different energy technologies subject to review for CIA.

The Sudbury-Hudson project was an underground transmission line, which would require a 1/4 mile radius around that project.


### Step 2. Determine if SGA Overlaps with BA

To determine if the Sudbury-Hudson project is within or near a BA, we examine whether the SGA (including a buffer of the specified radius) overlaps or intersects with "Burdened Areas" (BAs) as identified by the [MassEnviroScreen tool](https://profluna.github.io/MassEnviroScreen/). @fig-sga below is an interactive map showing the transmission line, a 1/4 mile buffer, and the census block groups that intersect with that 1/4 mile buffer. The block group highlighted in red is a BA.

@fig-sga shows that the SGA of the Sudbury-Hudson transmission line intersects with 14 census block groups, including 1 block group designated as BA. Based on guidance, the project would require a CIA. 


### Step 3. Catalog Indicators within SGA

Using data from [MassEnviroScreen](https://profluna.github.io/MassEnviroScreen/), the project applicant must document the values of all the indicators which inform the cumulative impact score. They must highlight all current indicators which exceed the 50th percentile for the specific indicator. This comprehensive inventory establishes the baseline conditions that will be used to assess the project’s incremental impact.

QUESTIONS:

- Do we want to see indicators for all 14 block groups, or just the BA?
- Do we flag 50th percentile for all 14 block groups, or just the BA?

### Step 4. Identify Impacts on Key Indicators

Using the list of relevant, technology-specific indicators established by the EFSB, the project applicant must assess and document the anticipated impact of the proposed project on each indicator within the SGA. The project applicant must determine whether the project will exacerbate any indicator that already exceeds the 50th percentile statewide threshold or cause any additional indicator to exceed the 50th percentile threshold. If either condition is met, the impact is considered a disproportionate adverse effect for that indicator.

@tbl-kpi below lists the key indicators by technology type as identified by the EFSB.

QUESTIONS:

- Do we want to see key indicators for all 14 block groups, or just the BA?
- Do we flag 50th percentile for all 14 block groups, or just the BA?
- How do we determine the level of impact on any indicator? Does EFSB have metrics of impacts?
