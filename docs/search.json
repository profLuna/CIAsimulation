    "text": "This document provides an analysis and simulation of the Cumulative Impact Analysis (CIA) process for clean energy projects as proposed by the Office of Environmental Justice and Equity (OEJE). The simulation focuses on the Sudbbury-Hudson underground transmission line to illustrate the steps in the CIA process and output generated. The rest of the document proceeds stepwise through the CIA process as described by OEJE.\n\n\nThe first step is to identify the Specific Geographic Area (SGA) of the proposed project. The SGA of a project is defined by the geographic location of the project and its physical footprint, as well as a radius around the project determined by the Energy Facilities Siting Board (EFSB). Table 1 below describes the radii of different energy technologies subject to review for CIA.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Specific Geographic Areas for CIA in EFSB Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Technology\nProposed SGA Radius\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nTransmission and Distribution Lines\n1/4 mile\nConstruction and visual impacts attenuate beyond this radius; emergency response considerations\n\n\nBattery Energy Storage System\n1 mile\nConstruction and visual impacts attenuate beyond this radius; emergency response considerations\n\n\nSubstation\n1/2 mile\nConstruction and visual impacts attenuate beyond this radius; emergency response considerations\n\n\nGround-Mounted PV\n1/2 mile\nConstruction and visual impacts attenuate beyond this radius; emergency response considerations\n\n\nOnshore Wind Facility/ Anaerobic Digester &gt; 25MW\n1 mile\nConstruction and visual impacts attenuate beyond this radius; emergency response considerations\n\n\nLNG Facility\n1 mile (no Air permit)\n2 miles (non-Major Air)\nConstruction and visual impacts attenuate beyond this radius; emergency response considerations\n\n\nPipeline\n1/2 mile\nConstruction and visual impacts attenuate beyond this radius; emergency response considerations\n\n\nFossil Generating Facility\n2 miles (non-Major)\n5 miles (Major)\nConstruction and visual impacts attenuate beyond this radius; emergency response considerations\n\n\nCompressor Stations\n1 mile (no Air permit)\n2 miles (non-Major Air)\nConstruction and visual impacts attenuate beyond this radius; emergency response considerations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sudbury-Hudson project was an underground transmission line, which would require a 1/4 mile radius around that project.\n\n\n\nTo determine if the Sudbury-Hudson project is within or near a BA, we examine whether the SGA (including a buffer of the specified radius) overlaps or intersects with “Burdened Areas” (BAs) as identified by the MassEnviroScreen tool. Figure 1 below is an interactive map showing the transmission line, a 1/4 mile buffer, and the census block groups that intersect with that 1/4 mile buffer. The block group highlighted in red is a BA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that the SGA of the Sudbury-Hudson transmission line intersects with 14 census block groups, including 1 block group designated as BA. Based on guidance, the project would require a CIA.\n\n\n\nUsing data from MassEnviroScreen, the project applicant must document the values of all the indicators which inform the cumulative impact score. They must highlight all current indicators which exceed the 50th percentile for the specific indicator. This comprehensive inventory establishes the baseline conditions that will be used to assess the project’s incremental impact.\nTable 2 shows the MassEnviroScreen indicator values for the Burdened Area within the SGA.
