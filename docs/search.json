    "text": "Step 4. Identify Impacts on Key Indicators\nUsing the list of relevant, technology-specific indicators established by the EFSB, the project applicant must assess and document the anticipated impact of the proposed project on each indicator within the SGA. The project applicant must determine whether the project will exacerbate any indicator that already exceeds the 50th percentile threshold or cause any additional indicator to exceed the 50th percentile threshold. If either condition is met, the impact is considered a disproportionate adverse effect for that indicator.\nTable 3 below lists the key indicators by technology type as identified by the EFSB.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4a. Determine Project Impact Level\nThe impact on each key indicator is assessed using a qualitative ranking of project impact, which is based on guidelines provided by OEJE and EFSB. Project impact ranks can be one of the following:\n\nNo Discernible Impact\nNegligible Burdens\nMinor Burdens\nModerate Burdens\nMajor Burdens\n\nThe project proponent will be provided with clear and concise guidance on assigning a project impact rank. Guidance should be provided for evaluating impacts on each unique indicator.\n\n\n4b.
