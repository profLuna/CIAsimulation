At its broadest level, the PIF strategy conceptualizes impacts on a continuum, ranging from “major burdens” to “no discernible impact” to “major benefits.” These impacts are compensable, such that benefits can mathematically offset burdens, and vice versa. This approach can be further subdivided into two phases: the construction phase and the operation phase. The operation phase is weighted more heavily because the effects endure over a longer time period. While the determination of level of impact (e.g., “moderate” or “major” burden) should be based on expert judgment, the numerical value assigned to a given level of impact is essentially arbitrary. However, given the four levels of impact proposed by EFSB, a logical approach to quantification would be to use quartiles - 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25. If the construction phase is conceived as having half the impact of the operation phase, these quartile values can be broken into complementary values, such that the construction phase value is half that of the operation phase value, and the sum of both equals the respective quartile. To achieve this, Construction phase values are computed as 1/3 of the quartile values for a given level, and Operation phase values are computed as 2/3 of the quartile value for a given level. The latter ensure that the construction phase values are one-half that of the operation phase values, and the sum of these complementary values adds up to the quartile value of a given level (see Table 4).\nphaseC = 1/3 * quartile level value\nphaseO = 2/3 * quartile level value\nphaseC + phaseO = quartile value\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Key Indicator Impact Levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact Level\nConstruction Phase\nOperation Phase\nQuartile Sum\n\n\n\n\nMajor Benefits\n-0.33\n-0.67\n-1.00\n\n\nModerate Benefits\n-0.25\n-0.50\n-0.75\n\n\nMinor Benefits\n-0.17\n-0.33\n-0.50\n\n\nNegligible Benefits\n-0.08\n-0.17\n-0.25\n\n\nNo Discernible Project Benefits or Burdens\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nNegligible Burdens\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\n\n\nMinor Burdens\n0.17\n0.33\n0.50\n\n\nModerate Burdens\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n\n\nMajor Burdens\n0.33\n0.67\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to OEJE guidance, “A disproportionate adverse effect occurs when the project exacerbates already high-impact indicators or pushes others beyond critical thresholds.” This statement can be interpreted to mean the following:\n\nIf a project adds to a burden that is already above the critical threshold in a Burdened Area (e.g., 50th percentile), it is by definition exacerbating an already high-impact indicator - a disproportionate adverse effect\nIf a project pushes or raises an indicator beyond a critical threshold in a Burdened Area (e.g., 50th percentile), it creates a disproportionate adverse effect\n\nItem 1 is essentially a threshold situation. Adding burden to an indicator that already exceeds the critical threshold in a Burdened Area is ipso facto a disproportionate adverse effect. In other words, the project is adding inequitable levels of burden on a key indicator to an already overburdened community. If we are reluctant to accept such trigger, we could declare that impacts must have a “minor” or greater burden to trigger such a determination.\nItem 2 is more complicated. How do we quantify the incremental impact of a burden in terms of comparative percentiles? If we build on our quartile logic, we could assume that a negligible burden increases the percentile value by up to 2.5%, minor burden by up to 5%, moderate burden by up to 7.5%, and major burden by up to 10% - essentially multiplying the quartiles by 10.\nTable 5 below shows the relative impacts on key indicators for the Sudbury Hudson transmission line project using the above logic. These are a subset of the identified key indicators for a transmission project for illustration purposes. Raw values for the indicators, as well as percentile values - statewide and relative to non-Burdened Areas - are shown as well. The latter are highlighted in red if they exceed the 50th percentile. Project Impact Factors (PIFs) for the construction and operation phases, as well as the sum of these, are shown for each indicator, based on EFSB modeling. Note, however, that the PIF values have been modified to be on a quartile basis. Finally, the last column showing PIF Level indicates the overall level of impact. Items highlighted in red indicate a potential “disproportionate adverse effect” because there is negligible or greater impact on an indicator that was already above the 50th percentile for non-Burdened Areas.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Estimated Project Impacts on Key Indicators\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nRaw Value\nStatewide Percentile\nnon-BA Percentile\nConstruction PIF\nOperation PIF\nPIF Sum\nPIF Level\n\n\n\n\nPM25\n6.76\n70\n70.3\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\nDSLPM\n0.13\n35\n42.5\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\nPTRAF\n2083136.64\n26\n34\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\nDWATER\n2.00\n71\n76.4\n0.08\n-0.33\n-0.25\nNegligible Benefits\n\n\nCancerRisk\n24.18\n40.2\n44.6\n0.17\n0.00\n0.17\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\ncleanup_score\n20.00\n75.2\n79.7\n0.17\n-0.17\n0.00\nNo Discernible Impact\n\n\nBWPScore\n3.00\n58.7\n62.9\n0.17\n0.00\n0.17\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\nWHPmean\n5.11\n48.4\n61.2\n0.17\n0.00\n0.17\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\npctFldArea\n23.84\n73.9\n76.9\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\nNo Discernible Impact\n\n\nHeatmean\n418.00\n77\n79\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe precision of these values, or the PIF values on which they are based, should not be over interpreted. These values convey a relative impact, based on expert judgement. They are not a substitute for empirically derived values or modeled estimates of absolute impact, such as values derived from air dispersion modeling. As a result, the level of mitigation required for an impacted indicator must be determined in some alternative way. Equally important, the CIA process should allow for situations in which stakeholders can in fact produce empirically based estimates of absolute impacts for key indicators (e.g., PM25 in micrograms per cubic meter).\n\n\n\nFollowing the proposed regulations by OEJE, there are two ways to set baseline conditions for determining a disproportionate adverse effect:\n\ncomparison against the statewide 50th percentile for a given indicator\ncomparison against the 50th percentile for non-Burdened Areas\n\nWe can explore the significance of these choices by looking at the frequency of 50th percentile exceedances for Burdened Areas in MassEnviroScreen. In other words, how often do Burdened Areas in MassEnviroScreen exceed the 50th percentile when the statewide baseline is used? How often do they exceed the 50th percentile when the baseline is based on non-Burdened Areas?\nTable 6 shows statistics on frequency of exceedances using these different baselines. Values indicate the number of exceedances by census block group. For example, using the statewide baseline, the smallest number of exceedances for a burdened area block group is 4 exceedances, and maximum is 27. In comparison, using the non-Burdened Area baseline, the smallest number of exceedances is 6, and the maximum is also 27.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: MassEnviroScreen Exceedances from Statewide versus non-Burdened Area Baselines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistic\nStatewide\nNon-Burdened Areas\n\n\n\n\nmin\n4.0\n6.0\n\n\nmedian\n16.0\n18.0\n\n\nmean\n16.4\n17.6\n\n\nstdev\n3.4\n3.4\n\n\nq25\n14.0\n15.0\n\n\nq75\n19.0\n20.0\n\n\nmax\n27.0\n27.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also map the exceedances to explore whether there are significant differences in the geographic distribution of exceedances."

At its broadest level, the PIF strategy conceptualizes impacts on a continuum, ranging from “major burdens” to “no discernible impact” to “major benefits.” These impacts are compensable, such that benefits can mathematically offset burdens, and vice versa. This approach can be further subdivided into two phases: the construction phase and the operation phase. The operation phase is weighted more heavily because the effects endure over a longer time period. While the determination of level of impact (e.g., “moderate” or “major” burden) should be based on expert judgment, the numerical value assigned to a given level of impact is essentially arbitrary. However, given the four levels of impact proposed by EFSB, a logical approach to quantification would be to use quartiles - 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25. If the construction phase is conceived as having half the impact of the operation phase, these quartile values can be broken into complementary values, such that the construction phase value is half that of the operation phase value, and the sum of both equals the respective quartile. To achieve this, Construction phase values are computed as 1/3 of the quartile values for a given level, and Operation phase values are computed as 2/3 of the quartile value for a given level. The latter ensure that the construction phase values are one-half that of the operation phase values, and the sum of these complementary values adds up to the quartile value of a given level (see Table 4).\nphaseC = 1/3 * quartile level value\nphaseO = 2/3 * quartile level value\nphaseC + phaseO = quartile value\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Key Indicator Impact Levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact Level\nConstruction Phase\nOperation Phase\nQuartile Sum\n\n\n\n\nMajor Benefits\n-0.33\n-0.67\n-1.00\n\n\nModerate Benefits\n-0.25\n-0.50\n-0.75\n\n\nMinor Benefits\n-0.17\n-0.33\n-0.50\n\n\nNegligible Benefits\n-0.08\n-0.17\n-0.25\n\n\nNo Discernible Project Benefits or Burdens\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nNegligible Burdens\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\n\n\nMinor Burdens\n0.17\n0.33\n0.50\n\n\nModerate Burdens\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n\n\nMajor Burdens\n0.33\n0.67\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to OEJE guidance, “A disproportionate adverse effect occurs when the project exacerbates already high-impact indicators or pushes others beyond critical thresholds.” This statement can be interpreted to mean the following:\n\nIf a project adds to a burden that is already above the critical threshold in a Burdened Area (e.g., 50th percentile), it is by definition exacerbating an already high-impact indicator - a disproportionate adverse effect\nIf a project pushes or raises an indicator beyond a critical threshold in a Burdened Area (e.g., 50th percentile), it creates a disproportionate adverse effect\n\nItem 1 is essentially a threshold situation. Adding burden to an indicator that already exceeds the critical threshold in a Burdened Area is ipso facto a disproportionate adverse effect. In other words, the project is adding inequitable levels of burden on a key indicator to an already overburdened community. If we are reluctant to accept such trigger, we could declare that impacts must have a “minor” or greater burden to trigger such a determination.\nItem 2 is more complicated. How do we quantify the incremental impact of a burden in terms of comparative percentiles? If we build on our quartile logic, we could assume that a negligible burden increases the percentile value by up to 2.5%, minor burden by up to 5%, moderate burden by up to 7.5%, and major burden by up to 10% - essentially multiplying the quartiles by 10.\nTable 5 below shows the relative impacts on key indicators for the Sudbury Hudson transmission line project using the above logic. These are a subset of the identified key indicators for a transmission project for illustration purposes. Raw values for the indicators, as well as percentile values - statewide and relative to non-Burdened Areas - are shown as well. The latter are highlighted in red if they exceed the 50th percentile. Project Impact Factors (PIFs) for the construction and operation phases, as well as the sum of these, are shown for each indicator, based on EFSB modeling. Note, however, that the PIF values have been modified to be on a quartile basis. Finally, the last column showing PIF Level indicates the overall level of impact. Items highlighted in red indicate a potential “disproportionate adverse effect” because there is negligible or greater impact on an indicator that was already above the 50th percentile for non-Burdened Areas.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Estimated Project Impacts on Key Indicators\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nRaw Value\nStatewide Percentile\nnon-BA Percentile\nConstruction PIF\nOperation PIF\nPIF Sum\nPIF Level\n\n\n\n\nPM25\n6.76\n70\n70.3\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\nDSLPM\n0.13\n35\n42.5\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\nPTRAF\n2083136.64\n26\n34\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\nDWATER\n2.00\n71\n76.4\n0.08\n-0.33\n-0.25\nNegligible Benefits\n\n\nCancerRisk\n24.18\n40.2\n44.6\n0.17\n0.00\n0.17\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\ncleanup_score\n20.00\n75.2\n79.7\n0.17\n-0.17\n0.00\nNo Discernible Impact\n\n\nBWPScore\n3.00\n58.7\n62.9\n0.17\n0.00\n0.17\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\nWHPmean\n5.11\n48.4\n61.2\n0.17\n0.00\n0.17\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\npctFldArea\n23.84\n73.9\n76.9\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\nNo Discernible Impact\n\n\nHeatmean\n418.00\n77\n79\n0.08\n0.17\n0.25\nNegligible Burdens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe precision of these values, or the PIF values on which they are based, should not be over interpreted. These values convey a relative impact, based on expert judgement. They are not a substitute for empirically derived values or modeled estimates of absolute impact, such as values derived from air dispersion modeling. As a result, the level of mitigation required for an impacted indicator must be determined in some alternative way. Equally important, the CIA process should allow for situations in which stakeholders can in fact produce empirically based estimates of absolute impacts for key indicators (e.g., PM25 in micrograms per cubic meter).\n\n\n\nFollowing the proposed regulations by OEJE, there are two ways to set baseline conditions for determining a disproportionate adverse effect:\n\ncomparison against the statewide 50th percentile for a given indicator\ncomparison against the 50th percentile for non-Burdened Areas\n\nWe can explore the significance of these choices by looking at the frequency of 50th percentile exceedances for Burdened Areas in MassEnviroScreen. In other words, how often do Burdened Areas in MassEnviroScreen exceed the 50th percentile when the statewide baseline is used? How often do they exceed the 50th percentile when the baseline is based on non-Burdened Areas?\nTable 6 shows statistics on frequency of exceedances using these different baselines. Values indicate the number of exceedances by census block group. For example, using the statewide baseline, the smallest number of exceedances for a burdened area block group is 4 exceedances, and maximum is 27. In comparison, using the non-Burdened Area baseline, the smallest number of exceedances is 6, and the maximum is also 27.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: MassEnviroScreen Exceedances from Statewide versus non-Burdened Area Baselines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistic\nStatewide\nNon-Burdened Areas\n\n\n\n\nmin\n4.0\n6.0\n\n\nmedian\n16.0\n18.0\n\n\nmean\n16.4\n17.6\n\n\nstdev\n3.4\n3.4\n\n\nq25\n14.0\n15.0\n\n\nq75\n19.0\n20.0\n\n\nmax\n27.0\n27.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also map the exceedances to explore whether there are significant differences in the geographic distribution of exceedances."
